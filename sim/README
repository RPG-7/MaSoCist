Hint: You can specify the top level entity for building various
simulation options, like:

> make SIM_TOP=virtualjtag

See ../hdl/tap/configuration_tap_<PLATFORM>.vhdl for configuration options.

This ONLY works when you have the virtual JTAG library (non-free) installed
and CONFIG_VTAP_JTAG is enabled.

Building simulator Windows executables:

- Make sure ghdlex is built properly:

> make PLATFORM=mingw32 clean all

Then set CONFIG_MINGW32 and recompile (clean all)
