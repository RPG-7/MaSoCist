The ZPUng is a pipelined stackmachine design, fully opcode-compatible to
the ZPU architecture conceived by Oyvind Harboe.

It is the core engine in commercial solutions offered by section5.ch:

- netpp node / IoT for FPGA: A network property protocol featured SoM
  (System on Module) for remote controlled safety relevant logic
- JPEG_L2 MJPEG streaming engine: RFC2435 compliant high performance
  (low power) motion JPEG movie streaming IP core


Note: The ZPUng implementation in this directory is solely delivered
as VHDL in a *fixed* configuration for evaluation of virtual hardware.
It can run in the simulation and is verified for synthesis on various
FPGA platforms.

It is not considered 'open source' as it is generated code.

You may use the ZPUng in personal projects, if you integrate it into
a commercial product, you are required to sign up for a license agreement.
