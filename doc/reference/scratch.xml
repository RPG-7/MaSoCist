    <title>Scratch Pad RAM</title>

    <para>Some configurations, when listed in the peripheral map, have a
    scratch pad RAM area mapped to the MMR address specified by the
    corresponding register map. In the beatrix configuration, this memory is
    just used as an extra data storage area. It can be used by peripheral
    hardware to exchange data with the CPU, like the TRACE module. The data
    width and size (in bytes) of the mapped memory is specified by the
    ScratchPad_Base pseudo register, see below.</para>

    <para>In this configuration, the memory is mapped to the CPU with 32 bit
    width, so it is most effectively accessed using 32 bit accesses
    (uint32_t).</para>
