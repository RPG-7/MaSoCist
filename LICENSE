Contributions to MaSoCist
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you add code or make modifications to the MaSoCist environment,
check:

1) If you're contributing to an Opensource tree (check vendor/<VENDOR>/Kconfig
   for CONFIG_OPENSOURCE=y)
2) If you update a custom license vendor tree

Rules:

a) If CONFIG_OPENSOURCE is undefined, you are not obliged to publish
   your changes, if you are not making usage of MaSoCist IP
b) You may not change CONFIG_OPENSOURCE back to undefined (this would
   be in violation of the OpenSource license)
c) Please add yourself as author to the header of the file you're authoring
   (except for minor changes, such as fixing bugs) and add a license
   description, like:

   SILIMAX dual license: MaSoCist Opensource and internal changes reserved

If you *author* a new core and add it to the OpenSource tree, you still
own sub-licensing rights. Means, if someone would want to use your core under
a custom closed source license, you would be contacted and you'd have the
freedom of setting the conditions for a commercial license purchase option.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
License mixtures

This is a very complicated subject. The components of the MaSoCist build
environment are subject to different licenses, some of them may not be
included in your distribution package.
The component included in your distribution is noted in the
config.mk vendor file.

1) netpp: OpenSource license (Dual use)
2) ghdlex: OpenSource with closed source modules
3) gensoc [CONFIG_HAVE_GENSOC]: Commercial license
4) vtap [CONFIG_HAVE_VTAP]: virtual TAP library (closed source)
5) vendor specific licenses for synthesizable HDL: See vendor specific
   HDL file. They are not included in the MaSoCist distribution.

Whether you have a license for a specific component is found in the
vendor/<YOUR_VENDOR_NAME>/config.mk

Special vendor names:

[public] : Public code, not OpenSource
[opensource] : OpenSource distribution

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom licensing

If you wish to make use of the MaSoCist for commercial purposes, this is
the typical way to go:

1) We set up a licensing contract for the desired components
2) A vendor name is registered for you in the 'master' tree
3) A specific git branch is set up for you
4) Access to future updates of the commercial tree is granted for a
   determined maintenance period, up to ten years. This entitles you
   to pull updates and changes from the master tree.
5) A docker container is provided to you such that you can run the reference
   system for an indeterminate period, avoiding future maintenance costs
